# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
- Contract deployed to: 0x730040C744bf8b56042A00b7D8973A4aD6181154 
- You have to create secret.json = {
  url: get it from moralis speedy node,
  key: metamask private key
}
- Create env that has your api_key from etherscan
